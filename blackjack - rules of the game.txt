Introduction to Blackjack
Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One, is a popular casino card game where the objective is to get a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over 21. It is one of the most widely played casino banking games in the world.

The Deck and Card Values
  - A standard deck of 52 cards is used.
  - The cards have the following values:
      • Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
      • Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
      • Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player's hand the most.

The Objective
The goal in Blackjack is to have a hand value that is higher than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.

The Deal
  - The player places a bet.
  - The dealer deals two cards face up to the player and two cards, one face up and one face down, to themselves.

Player's Options
After the initial deal, the player has the following options:
  1. Hit: The player requests an additional card from the dealer to try to get closer to 21.
  2. Stand: The player is satisfied with their current hand and does not want any more cards.
  3. Double Down: The player doubles their initial bet and receives one more card.
  4. Split: If the player's first two cards are of the same rank, they can split them into two separate hands, each with a separate bet.
  5. Insurance: If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, the player can make an additional bet (up to half their original bet) that the dealer has Blackjack (a hand value of 21).

Dealer's Play
After the player has completed their turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card and follows a set of predetermined rules:
  - If the dealer's hand is 16 or less, they must hit.
  - If the dealer's hand is 17 or more, they must stand.

Determining the Winner
  - If the player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value, the player wins.
  - If the player's hand value exceeds 21, the player loses (busts).
  - If the player and the dealer have the same hand value, it is a push (tie), and the player's bet is returned.
  - If the player has Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card), they win 3:2 on their bet, unless the dealer also has Blackjack, in which case it is a push.

Additional Rules and Variations
There are various rules and variations that can be found in different Blackjack games, such as:
  - Surrender: The player can forfeit half their bet and give up their hand.
  - Blackjack Payouts: Some casinos may offer different payout ratios for Blackjack, such as 6:5 or 3:2.
  - Side Bets: Some Blackjack games offer optional side bets, such as "Perfect Pairs" or "21+3".
